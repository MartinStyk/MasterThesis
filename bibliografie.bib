abstract="Although anyone can easily publish Android applications (or apps) in an app marketplace according to an open policy, decompiling the apps is also easy due to the structural characteristics of the app building process, making them very vulnerable to forgery or modification attacks. In particular, users may suffer direct financial loss if this vulnerability is exploited in security-critical private and business applications, such as online banking. In this paper, some of the major Android-based smartphone banking apps in Korea being distributed on either the Android Market or the third party market were tested to verify whether a money transfer could be made to an unintended recipient. The experimental results with real Android banking apps showed that an attack of this kind is possible without having to illegally obtain any of the sender's personal information, such as the senders public key certificate, the password to their bank account, or their security card. In addition, the cause of this vulnerability is analyzed and some technical countermeasures are discussed.",

abstract="Plagiarism cases are quite common in mobile applications ecosystems like the Android market. An application can be decompiled, modified and repackaged with a different author name. The modifications can affect the user's privacy or even contain malicious logic. If the original application is supported by advertisements, they are usually replaced so the ad revenue will go to the repackager. Such events can cause the legitimate author damage both in reputation and financially so they need to be detected. A plagiarism detection system is proposed that can detect plagiarized applications based on the features extracted from code. Two similarity functions are given along with techniques for finding similar applications in a large collection. The main issue with this search is that it cannot be performed sequentially, by comparing a given item with every other item in the collection. The built solution will improve the search time by comparing the searched item only with those with a high probability of being similar. The greatest advantage of our approach is scalability. The system's database can be built, updated and queried in reasonable time, even when large quantities of data are involved. Our experiments were conducted on a large collection of over one million samples and managed to identify a concerning number of plagiarism cases.",

abstract="Android app repackaging threatens the health of application markets, as repackaged apps, besides stealing revenue for honest developers, are also a source of malware distribution. Techniques that rely on visual similarity of Android apps recently emerged as a way to tackle the repackaging detection problem, as code-based detection techniques often fail in terms of efficiency, and effectiveness when obfuscation is applied [19, 21]. Among such techniques, the resource-based repackaging detection approach that compares sets of files included in apks has arguably the best performance [10, 17, 20]. Yet, this approach has not been previously validated on a dataset of repackaged apps.",

abstract="The ease of Android applications repackaging and proliferation of application clones in Google Play and other markets call for new effective techniques to detect repackaged code and combat distribution of cloned applications. Today all existing techniques for repackaging detection are based on code similarity or feature (e.g., permission set) similarity evaluation. We propose a new approach to detect repackaging based on the resource files available in application packages. Our tool called FSquaDRA performs a quick pairwise application comparison (full pairwise comparison for 55,000 applications in just 80 hours on a laptop), as it measures how many identical resources are present inside both packages under analysis. The intuition behind our approach is that malicious repackaged applications still need to maintain the ``look and feel'' of the originals by including the same images and other resource files, even though they might have additional code included or some of the original code removed.",
